//! Traits for writing and composing hooks.
//!
//! ## Hook points
//!
//! Penrose offers several different hook points where you are able to provide custom
//! logic to execute as part of the main WindowManager event loop. Unlike logic you
//! add as KeyEventHandlers, hooks will be run automatically by Penrose as and when
//! the conditions for their execution arises. Each hook point requires a specific
//! trait to be implemented and in the simplest case, functions with the correct
//! type signature can be used directly (though you will likely want to implement
//! traits directly if you are looking for more control over how your hook logic is
//! run.
//!
//!
//! ### Startup Hooks
//!
//! Startup hooks are implemented using the [`StateHook`] trait, allowing you access
//! to the pure WindowManager internal [`State`] and the [`XConn`] in order to run
//! any set up code you need which requires the bindings to already have been
//! grabbed but before any existing clients are parsed and managed by the WindowManager.
//!
//! > **NOTE**: Startup hooks are run to completion before entering the main event loop.
//!
//! ### Event Hooks
//!
//! The [`EventHook`] trait allows you to pre-process incoming [`XEvent`]s as they
//! arrive from the X server, _before_ they are seen by the default event handling logic.
//! This allows you to intercept or modify incoming events as you need and act
//! accordingly. Maybe you want to keep track of changes to a specific property on clients
//! or maybe you want to know if a specific client is being destroyed.
//!
//! This hook returns a `bool` indicating whether or not the default event handling logic
//! needs to run after your hook has finished: to run the default handling you should return
//! `true`, to skip the handling (and prevent the normal behaviour for such an event) you
//! can return `false`.
//!
//! > **NOTE**: Be careful about disabling default event handling! If you drop events
//! >           that are required for the normal behaviour of the WindowManager then you
//! >           will need to make sure that you track and maintain any required state
//! >           that may now be missing.
//!
//! ### Manage Hooks
//!
//! [`ManageHook`]s let you run some additional logic to optionally modify the pure
//! window manager state _after_ a newly managed client has been processed and stored, but
//! before that change is applied to the X server. This allows you to modify how the new
//! client is set up when it first appears, such as moving it to a specific workspace or
//! marking it as floating in a specific position. There are some reference hooks in the
//! [extensions module][0] that can serve as a starting point for looking at the sorts of
//! things that are possible.
//!
//! > **NOTE**: ManageHooks should _not_ directly trigger a refresh of the X state!
//! >           They are already called by the XConn immediately before refreshing so all
//! >           triggering a refresh directly will do is run the refresh twice: once with
//! >           the initial state of the client before your hook was applied and once after.
//!
//! ### Layout Hooks
//!
//! Next we have [`LayoutHook`]s which operate a little differently, in that they have
//! two methods to implement. Layout hooks are run _around_ whatever [Layout][1] is active
//! for the focused workspace, allowing you to modify the screen dimensions available for the
//! layout algorithm before it runs and editing the list of window positions it generates
//! before they are applied. This lets you do things like prevent windows being positioned on
//! certain parts of the screen, or injecting/removing additional window positions.
//!
//! This is somewhat similar to the [`LayoutTransformer`] trait which is a wrapper around a
//! specific Layout, but it doesn't allow for introspection of the underlying Layout or
//! responding to Messages. On the plus side, layout hooks are registered and run centrally
//! rather than needing to be applied to each Layout you want to add that behaviour to.
//!
//! ### Refresh Hooks
//!
//! Refresh hooks are implemented using the same [`StateHook`] trait used for Startup hooks.
//! In this case however, your hook will be run each time the XConn refreshes the X state in
//! response to changes being made to the internal state of the WindowManager.
//! This is one of the more general purpose hooks available for you to make use of and can be
//! used to run code any time something changes in the internal state of your window manager.
//!
//! ## Setting and composing hooks
//!
//! Each kind of hook has a corresponding `compose_or_set_*_hook` method on the [Config][2]
//! struct. If multiple hooks of the same type are registered they are composed together as
//! a stack, with the most recently added hook running first (keep this in mind if the hooks
//! you are registering have any potential interactions in how they operate).
//!
